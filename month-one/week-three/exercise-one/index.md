In this exercise we were tasked with setting up Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on our local machine using an installation host in this cas VirtualBox and Vagrant which is n open source software for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments.

We lent the basics of spinning up a virtual environment with Vagrant using the following commands **vagrant init "name of machine"** and running the **vagrant up** to get the environment running.
