### Exercise THree

In week four we learn about linux groups and users. We also talked SSH

##### Linux Groups

> A group is a collection of users in Linux. The primary use of groups is to specify a set of permissions, such as read, write, or execute permission for a certain resource, that can be shared by the group's members.

##### Linux Users

> In a Linux operating system, a user is an entity that has access to files and can carry out a number of additional tasks. In the operating system, an ID that is specific to each user is given to them.

##### SSH

> SSH, which stands for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol used in Linux. As data is transferred between the client and the host in encrypted form, the ssh command employs the secure ssh protocol. It sends the input to the host via the client and receives the output sent by the host before returning the input.

##### Sudoers File

> Administrators of Linux and Unix systems can assign system rights to users by using the sudoers file. As a result, the administrator can manage who does what.
