#### Exercise Five

In this module we talked about Git and Github. Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. In GIT, repositories are collections of files from several Project versions. These files are imported from the repository into the user's local server for additional updates and content changes. These versions are made using a VCS, or version control system, and are kept in a repository, which is a specified location. Cloning is the process of using different Git Tools to transfer the content from an existing Git Repository. The user receives the entire repository on his own computer after the cloning operation is finished. Once the cloning is complete, Git automatically assumes that all work to be done on the repository will be done as a user.

GitHub, is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
