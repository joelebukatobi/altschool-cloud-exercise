# AltSchool Cloud Engineering Journey

Hi! My name is JetDev and if you're reading this you've stumbled on my AltSchool Repository, I will be using this repository as a means of documenting my journey in the AltSchool Cloud Engineering Track.
The repository will be patterned according to the following folder structure **Month** > **Week** > **Exercise**. Each week will contain a README file explaining a brief hisitory of what we learnt that week in class and the exercise folder the corresponding exercises given during the course of the week.
