# AltSchool Cloud Engineering Journey

Hi! My name is JetDev and if you're reading this you've stumbled on my AltSchool Repository, which I will be using to document my journey through the AltSchool Cloud Engineering Track.
The repository will be patterned according to the following folder structure **Month** > **Week** > **Exercise**. Each week will contain a README file explaining a brief summary of what we learnt that week in class and the exercise folder the corresponding exercises given during the course of the week. You can use the table below to navigate through each stage in my journey to being a World Class Cloud Engineer.
